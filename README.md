# Face Detection and Landmark Detection with MediaPipe and Next.js

This project demonstrates real-time face detection and face landmark detection using MediaPipe's FaceDetector and FaceLandmarker within a Next.js application. The application captures video from the user's webcam, detects faces or facial landmarks, and displays them on a canvas overlay. It also allows the user to take snapshots and record videos of the detected faces or landmarks.
